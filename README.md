## üßÆ Algorithm Details

### Constraint Priority
1. **Avoid Requests**: Highest priority (hard constraint)
2. **Team Size Limits**: Hard constraint
3. **Gender Requirements**: Hard constraint
4. **Mutual Teammate Requests**: Honored when possible
5. **Skill Balance**: Optimized after other constraints

### Team Generation Process
1. Parse and validate player data
2. Identify mutual teammate requests (both players must request each other)
3. Create constraint groups (pairs + individuals)
4. Sort groups by constraint complexity
5. Assign groups to teams while respecting all constraints
6. Balance teams by skill level through strategic swaps
7. Report unassigned players and constraint violations
